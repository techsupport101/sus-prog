Hello!

This is the code for VEX V5RC team [num] [name] for the 2024-2025 game High Stakes. This includes autonomous, driver control, and Robot Skills Challenge code. Using Git and Github allows our programmers to collaborate efficiently on code. 

We use the PROS CLI and the PROS API to make our code more advanced and easier to edit in the free Visual Studio Code text editor. The program files are located in the `src` folder.

Have fun looking through our code!
