Hello!

This is the code for VEX V5RC team [num] [name] for the 2024-2025 game High Stakes. This includes autonomous, driver control, and Robot Skills Challenge code. Using Git and Github allows our programmers[^1] and mentor[^2] to collaborate efficiently on code. 

We use the PROS CLI and the PROS API to make our code more advanced and easier to edit in the free Visual Studio Code text editor in C++. The main program files are located in the `src` folder. We also have our old block code[^3] converted to text code which is located in the `blockCode` folder.

If you would like to give us any feedback, please report it as an issue in Github. This can be done by clicking the **Issues** tab on the toolbar at the top of the webpage of our repo. Check our Contributing Guidelines if you want more info. We thank you for your advice in advance!

Have fun looking through our code!
